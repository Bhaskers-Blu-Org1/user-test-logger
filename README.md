# User Test Logger

Tooling user studies tasks is fundamental to reduce the burden of evaluators, practitioners, facilitators, and observers during user interface (UI) evaluations. However, available tools for collecting detailed data (i.e., beyond clicks streams) are paid or have a complex setup. In this context, we propose a general-purpose web browser plugin for Firefox to be used in local user studies. It provides detailed data logging, log download, and reporting features. The tool is freely available so that Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners can use it as a core tool for empirical evaluations or additional data source in mixed methods evaluations.

## Setup

The easiest way to tryout the tool is to:

1. Download the zip file;
2. Write about:debugging at the address bar;
3. Click on "Load Temporary add-on";
4. Locate the manifest.js file;
5. Confirm.
